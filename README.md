# Sabancı University DSA210 Fall 2024-2025 Term Project  
## Analyzing the Relationship Between Credit Card Spending and Weather Data  
I am Aysın Nur İpek (32393) and my project focuses on analyzing the relationship between my credit card spending data and weather patterns by examining transaction details and weather conditions.
### Description  
This project focuses on exploring how personal spending habits, categorized through credit card transactions, correlate with weather patterns in my location. Using my own credit card statement and publicly available weather data, I aim to uncover insights into how external factors like temperature and weather conditions influence spending across different categories. Additionally, the project will identify basic statistics within my dataset.

## Motivation  
The primary motivation for this project stems from the fact that my largest and most detailed dataset is my credit card spending and I needed a continous situation like weather conditions to make an analysis. This extensive dataset enables the analysis of spending behavior and its relationship with environmental conditions.  

By examining my spending patterns against weather data, I hope to:  
- Gain actionable insights into which spending categories are prominent in specific seasons.  
- Improve budgeting by understanding seasonal financial habits.  
- Provide predictive insights into my spending patterns for 2025 based on seasonal trends.

## Data Source  
The project incorporates two main data sources:  

### 1. Credit Card Data  
I manually converted into an Excel spreadsheet, my credit card data includes:  
- **Transaction Dates**: Exact dates of each transaction.  
- **Amounts**: Value of each purchase.  
- **Spending Categories**: Classified into groups such as groceries, transportation, and dining.  

### 2. Weather Data  
Derived from publicly available APIs and meteorological services, such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherStack, this dataset includes:  
- **Daily Temperature**: Recorded average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.  
- **General Weather Conditions**: Descriptions such as sunny, rainy, cloudy, or snowy.  

By integrating these datasets, I expect to analyze the connections between my spending habits and weather patterns, providing deeper insights into how weather conditions influence my financial decisions.

## Data Analysis  

### Techniques and Tools  
This project will use the following tools and libraries:  
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.  
- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and cleaning.  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations of trends and patterns.  
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and predictive analysis.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing and documenting the workflow.  
- **GitHub**: To host and share analysis scripts and documentation.
- **NumPy**: This library is going to be used for basic statistics calculation 
- **Weather API Integration**: For fetching and preprocessing weather data.  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
The EDA phase will involve:  
1. **Trend Analysis**: Investigating spending habits across categories to identify seasonal or behavioral patterns.  
2. **Weather Data Insights**: Examining the distribution of weather variables, such as temperature and general conditions.  
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring potential relationships between weather factors and spending behavior to understand how environmental conditions influence financial decisions.

## Data Visualization  

- **Time-series Graphs**: To depict spending trends alongside weather conditions over time.  
- **Scatterplots and Heatmaps**: To visualize correlations between weather patterns and spending behavior.  

---

## Modeling  

- **Regression Models**: To analyze predictive relationships between weather conditions and spending patterns.  
- **Clustering**: To group similar spending patterns based on weather conditions.  

---

## Expected Findings  

- Insights into spending categories most influenced by weather conditions.  
- Patterns such as:  
  - Increased spending on dining during rainy days.  
  - Higher clothing expenses during colder months.
  - Higher transportation expenses during school periods and colder days.

## Limitations  

1. **Data Completeness**: Missing datas such as weather or transaction data for certain days may limit the analysis.  
2. **Subjectivity**: Personal spending could also be influenced by factors like holidays or special occasions.  
3. **Privacy Concerns**: Sensitive credit card information will not be shared publicly.

## Future Work  

1. I might extend data to include following spendings for a longitudinal perspective.    
2. Apply machine learning techniques for enhanced prediction and analysis.
