# Sabanci University DSA210 Fall 2024-2025 Term Project
Analyzing the Relationship Between Credit Card Spending and Weather Data"
Description
Sabancı University CS210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project
This project focuses on exploring how personal spending habits, categorized through credit card transactions, correlate with weather patterns in my location. Using my own credit card statement and publicly available weather data, I aim to uncover insights into how external factors like temperature, precipitation, and weather conditions influence spending across different categories.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from a curiosity about the interplay between spending behavior and environmental conditions. By analyzing my spending patterns against weather data, I hope to gain actionable insights into my financial habits, which could be useful for better budgeting and understanding external factors that influence decision-making.

### Data Source
Credit Card Data: My credit card statements, which have been manually converted into an Excel spreadsheet. The data includes transaction dates, amounts, and spending categories (e.g., groceries, entertainment, dining, etc.).
Weather Data: Historical weather data sourced from publicly available APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or WeatherStack) or official meteorological services. This includes daily temperature, precipitation levels, and general weather conditions corresponding to the dates in my spending data.
### Tools
The project will leverage the following tools and libraries:

Python: For data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization of trends and patterns.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning models for predictive analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: For organizing and documenting the analysis process.
GitHub: Repository for sharing the analysis scripts and documentation.
Weather API Integration: Scripts to fetch and preprocess weather data.
Data Analysis Plan
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summarize credit card spending trends across categories.
Analyze the distribution of weather data.
Identify potential correlations between weather patterns and spending behavior.
### Visualization:

Time-series graphs to show spending trends alongside weather conditions.
Scatterplots and heatmaps to visualize correlations.
### Modeling:

Use regression models to explore predictive relationships between weather and spending.
Clustering to group similar spending patterns based on weather.
Expected Findings
Insights into which spending categories are most influenced by weather conditions.
Patterns such as increased spending on dining during rainy days or higher entertainment expenses during colder months.
### Limitations
Data Completeness: Missing weather or transaction data for certain days could limit the analysis.
Subjectivity: Personal spending may be influenced by factors other than weather, such as holidays or special occasions.
Privacy: Sensitive information in credit card statements will not be shared publicly.
Future Work
Extend the analysis to include multiple years for a longitudinal perspective.
Integrate additional external factors such as public holidays or local events.
Apply advanced machine learning techniques for better prediction and analysis.
Deliverables
A public GitHub repository containing:
Scripts for data processing and analysis.
A detailed README file explaining the dataset, methodology, and findings.
What I expect as a result?
